# Scientist in the loop - Automation of scientific discovery (SCI-AI)

2025-2029, [Research Council of Finland grant number #369925](https://research.fi/en/results/funding/83423)

*Where do new scientific ideas come from?* 

That is the question at the root of research on scientific discovery. In the past decade, AI-augmented methods have shaken the practices of discovery across a range of research fields: AlphaFold solved the long-standing protein folding problem; automated discovery methods are being used to decipher ancient scripts once considered unreadable, and to synthesize drugs for previously untreatable diseases. According to the most enthusiastic advocates, in less than a decade, AI will transform practices of research beyond recognition.

* *Should the novel scientific findings generated by AI-powered systems like AlphaFold be considered as instances of machine creativity?* 
* *When does human-AI collaboration lead to successful scientific problem solving, and when does it fail?* 
* *Are AI systems reconfiguring the scientific method?* 

Currently we cannot answer such questions, because systematic empirical studies of problem-solving activities in AI-augmented labs have not been conducted. Nor do we have the conceptual tools needed to evaluate the rationality of problem solving in AI-augmented labs. That is the gap the SCI-AI project addresses. The main aim of the project is to generate understanding of the AI-augmented discovery transformation and its consequences for the development of human knowledge. The main objectives are:

* *(A) to uncover and analyze problem-solving processes in AI-augmented labs,* 
* *(B) to examine the implications of AI-augmented discovery for the epistemology of science,* and 
* *(C) to use automated discovery as a mirror for exploring human creativity and intellect.*

To reach these objectives, the project combines **philosophical analysis** with **computational models of problem solving** and **ethnographic fieldwork** that we conduct in three frontier AI labs (a self-driving lab in biology, a closed-loop behavioural science lab, and a virtual lab using digital twin technology in drug development and atmospheric research).

# Institutional Epistemology workshops (INES)

Since 2022, Säde Hormio, Raul Hakli and I have been the core organizing team of Institutional Epistemology workshops (2022 and 2023). INES 2025 is coming up in June 2025. More information <a href="https://www.institutionalepistemology.net" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Some of our keynote speakers: Elizabeth Anderson, Helen Beebee, Jessica Brown, Cailin O'Connor, Gloria Origgi, Kristina Rolin, Daniel Steel, Alison Wylie and Kevin Zollman.

# European network for the Science of Science (EUROSCISCI)

In 2022-2023, together with Pantelis Analytis and Jacob Habinek, I organized a series of European workshops on the science of science.

# Modeling the republic of science: Collaborative problem solving and collective rationality in scientific inquiry (2020-2025)

In 2020-2025 my research is funded by the Academy of Finland.

#### Abstract

*“Art is I, science is we” – Claude Bernard*

Science is a deeply collaborative enterprise. Research is increasingly conducted by teams, and the reasons for many of its successes (e.g., mapping the human genome) and failures (e.g., replication crisis) are best understood by viewing science as a social system. The general aim of the project is to understand successful cognitive coordination in scientific communities: How should inquiry be organized so that the collaborative pursuit of knowledge is efficient, progressive and reliable?

Although the recent modeling work in the philosophy of science has provided insight into the socio-epistemic dynamics of scientific inquiry, scientific collaboration and epistemic interdependence in problem solving are still poorly understood topics. Instead, our models (both theoretical as well as those underlying institutional design) often emphasize competition as the institutional logic of research. Most of the current modeling approaches cannot be used to represent cases of collaborative problem solving, in which a complex research problem must be subdivided into more tractable tasks distributed across different individuals or teams within the scientific community. Furthermore, although the case-study-based literature on scientific collaboration is extensive, it alone does not provide a sufficient basis for systematic theorizing about the principles of cognitive collaboration and collective rationality in science.

My project addresses these shortcomings by combining philosophical analysis with computational modeling. First, it introduces two model templates for studying scientific collaboration (restless bandits; binary string model). Second, by providing an account of the epistemology of computational modeling, it positions the modeling-based results with respect to the broader philosophical and interdisciplinary literature on scientific collaboration. The questions addressed by the project include: Which patterns of communal information exchange are desirable – can too much communication between scientists be epistemically harmful? When do diverse problem-solving groups outperform more skilled but less diverse ones? How does non-modularity of research problems hinder success in multidisciplinary research teams?

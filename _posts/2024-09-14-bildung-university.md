This week I gave a short ![presentation](/assets/reijula_sivistysyliopiston_idea.pdf) on the idea of Bildung university ('sivistysyliopisto' in Finnish). The notion of Bildung doesn't quite translate to English but we have a word for it in Finnish, 'sivistys'. Here Bildung university refers to the modern concept of research university from early 19th century, first embodied by the University of Berlin (founded in 1810). 

It's a lofty ideal and many of the ideas behind it come from German enlightenment and neohumanism: Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Schleiermacher - and Humboldt. Although it seems like a politically implausible picture of autonomous universities and academic freedom again managerialist trends in higher education, the Bildung university model has been remarkably resilient, and successful. Despite various pressures and mutations along the way, it still lies at the heart of most research universities, not only in continental Europe but also in the US, where the German model was exported during the 19th century.

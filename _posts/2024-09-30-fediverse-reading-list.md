I've become increasingly interested in the fediverse. Thinking in terms of protocols instead of privately owned platforms could give us ways to address some of the epistemic challenges associated with the new AI-structured information landscape. My plan is to write something on this later on, but I'll start by gradually compiling a reading list on both technical and more conceptual thinking on the fediverse. I've been asking recommendations on social media on what to read.

The Fediverse is a new name for an old idea. From the beginning, the internet has been a network of networks, made possible by agreeing on shared protocols used for communication between machines (TCP/IP and so on). It's only in the past two decades or so that we've become used to the social web being based on closed, proprietary platforms like Facebook or Twitter. The idea behind the Fediverse is to bring the social web back to a decentralized model: protocols like ActivityPub or Bluesky's AT Protocol make inter-service sharing possible.

I have a couple of reasons why I care. First, I've realised I have a long history with text-based social media - I was involved in the dial-up modems and bulletin board scene in the 90s. More importantly, I think this is an interesting case of how institutions (& technology) matter for epistemology. Social web for the free world.

## The idea

Email is a useful analogy: Just as we don't all use the same email service, but mails still move between different services using the SMTP protocol, Fediverse protocols connect various nodes in a decentralized network. For example, you can host a Mastodon or Bluesky node yourself, own your data, or at least choose between different providers, none of which control the entire network. And if you decide to move from server to another, you're free to take your identity, data and connections with you. 

## Middleware

An important aspect of decentralized architecture is that different functions in the network can be taken care of by different service provides. For example, the work of filtering content for readers/viewers can be done by parties separate from those who host the data, and the apps people use to access the content. This has interesting implications on moderation and the way people's timelines are generated. It encourages people to build different views on the content posted on the network. In other words, we're not subject to one Algorithm, but instead, everyone gets to decide what shows up in their timeline. Bluesky has implemented this as Feeds, and I like it a lot.

I've become increasingly interested in the fediverse. Thinking in terms of protocols instead of privately owned platforms could give us ways to address some of the epistemic challenges associated with the new ML/AI information landscape. My plan is to write something on this later on, but I'll start by gradually compiling a reading list on both technical and more conceptual thinking on the fediverse. I've been asking recommendations on social media on what to read.

The Fediverse is a new name for an old idea. From the beginning, the internet has been a network of networks, made possible by agreeing on shared protocols used for communication between machines (TCP/IP and so on). It's only in the past two decades or so that we've become used to the social web being based on closed, proprietary platforms like Facebook or Twitter. The idea behind the Fediverse is to bring the social web back to a decentralized model: protocols like ActivityPub or Bluesky's AT Protocol make inter-service sharing possible.

A common analogy for the Fediverse is email: just as we don't all use the same email service, but emails still move between different services using the SMTP protocol, Fediverse protocols connect various nodes in a decentralized network. For example, you can host a Mastodon or Bluesky node yourself, own your data, or at least choose between different providers, none of which control the entire network. And if you decide to move from server to anotherm you're to take your data and connections with you. 

I have a couple of reasons why I care. First, I've realised I have a long history with text-based social media - I was involved in the dial-up modems and bulletin board scene in the 90s. More importantly, I think this is an interesting case of how institutions (& technology) matter for epistemology. Social web for the free world.

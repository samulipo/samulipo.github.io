title: Fediverse reading list

I've become increasingly interested in the fediverse. Thinking in terms of protocols instead of privately owned platforms could give us ways to address some of the epistemic challenges associated with the new ML/AI information landscape. My plan is to write something on this later on, but I'll start by gradually compiling a reading list on both technical and more conceptual thinking on the fediverse. I've been asking recommendations on social media on what to read.

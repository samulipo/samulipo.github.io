I finally uploaded my [materials](https://github.com/samulipo/abms-vienna) from the computational methods workshop at the 2022 Summer school of the Vienna doctoral school of philosophy. Some epistemology of modeling and hands-on ideas on how to get started with agent-based models in social epistemology. Thanks to the organizers Maximilian Noichl and Gareth Pearce!

NOBEL: Acemogku et al. Esimerkkeinä institutionaalisesta selittämisestä

In our [reply](https://social-epistemology.com/2024/05/27/ideal-institutional-epistemology-sade-hormio-and-samuli-reijula/) to professor Sharon Rider, Säde Hormio and I characterize institutional epistemology as follows:

"The abstractions and idealizations in our description of universities are motivated by an approach we call institutional epistemology (Reijula and Ylikoski 2020; Koskinen 2022): as social epistemology suggests, most questions worth answering are beyond the cognitive capacities of a single individual. Sociality, however, does not happen in an institutional vacuum. Instead, the way the social practices of inquiry (peer review, citation practices, career models etc.) are organized often have important epistemic implications. Focusing on the institutional rules and practices of a knowledge institution aims to uncover both the intended but also the unintended consequences of such practices (cf. Elster 2015). As social epistemologists have long argued, the boundary between social and cognitive is not clear (Longino 2022). Institutional epistemology tries to take that point seriously."

role of idelization and abstraction: "We believe such a research strategy sometimes allows for abstraction and idealization—simplification in order to bring the institutional logic into focus."

title: Diversity-ability-trade-off (Philosophy of Science)
categories: news, publication

We (myself and Jaakko Kuorikoski) have a new paper coming out in the Philosophy of Science (PSA2020/2021 proceedings). The paper examines the diversity-beats-ability theorem originally put forward by Lu Hong and Scott Page, 2004. Long story short, (1) we don't think the original model provides reliable evidence of diversity beating ability in group problem solving, but (2) we have an improved version of the model that can tell us something of interest about the trade-off between diversity and ability!

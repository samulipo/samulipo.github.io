Inspired by dinner debates around New Year's (2023), Renne Pesonen and I wrote an<a href="https://journal.fi/tt/article/view/131066/79967" target="_blank">essay</a>" (in Finnish) on large language models. We finally got it published in May in the journal Tieteess√§ Tapahtuu - I'm sure everyone was pretty tired with the topic already. But I still think we our own take on the topic. I haven't seen our main points made by others. 

Very briefly, we argue that from a cognitive-science standpoint, there is no in principle reason why LLMs could not be intelligent, creative or grasp meanings. Furthermore, LLMs are an existence proof of a simple(?) algoritmic system manifesting human-like intelligent (verbal) behavior. That should give rise to some intellectual humility: let's not flatter ourselves, perhaps the depths of the human soul are not as deep as we'd like to think. 

There may be an English version, or not.

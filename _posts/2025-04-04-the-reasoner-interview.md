[Lorenzo Casini](https://lorenzocasini.weebly.com) from [The Reasoner]([link](https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/thereasoner/article/view/28587/24047)) recently interviewed [Dunja Seselja](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/dunja-seselja), [Matteo Michelini](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/matteo-michelini) and me on agent-based modeling in the philosophy of science and social epistemology. Dunja has organized this amazing series of workshops called Simulations of Scientific Inquiry, and Lorenzo joined us as one of the keynote speakers at the latest workshop. 

Here's the [link](https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/thereasoner/article/view/28587/24047) to the interview. 

"If I had to pick one hypothesis to be tested in a real-world setting, Iâ€™d go with my work on bias and laziness" - says Matteo. Better find out what he's talking about!

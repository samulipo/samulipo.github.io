I'm a philosopher of science interested in ...

Currently I’m mainly working on projects related to two topics:
(1) **Science as a social system.** What are the social, cognitive and institutional conditions of well-functioning collective knowledge-production?
(2) **Evidence-based policy.** How are findings from the behavioral sciences used to inform policy design? How should that translation (ideally) be done?

I am also interested in the epistemology of simulation modeling, computational social science, AI, and issues related to natural kinds and conceptual change.

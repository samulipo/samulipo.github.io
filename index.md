# Samuli Reijula

*I am a philosopher and cognitive scientist interested in how science works, how it could, and how it should work.*

The aim of my current research project is to better understand scientific problem-solving: Science is the humanity's most successful problem-solving system, and the primary source of epistemic authority in modern societies. In my research, I view & model science as a distributed cognitive system, "problem-solving writ large." How does that system function at different levels of analysis ranging from individual scientists to research groups and scientific communities? And how should it function - what are the social, cognitive, and institutional preconditions of well-functioning scientific research?

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the philosophy of science at the University of Helsinki.

I’m currently working on projects related to two themes:  
- **Institutional epistemology.** What are epistemically well-designed social systems like? That is, what are the social, cognitive and institutional conditions of well-functioning scientific research?
- **Evidence-based policy.** How are findings from the behavioral sciences used to inform policy design? How should that translation be done?  

I am also interested in the **epistemology of simulation modeling**, **computational social science**, **AI**, as well as issues related to **natural kinds** and **conceptual change**.

I am affiliated with <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/tint/" target="_blank">TINT, the Centre for Philosophy of Social Science</a> at the University of Helsinki, and my research is funded by the Academy of Finland.

# Samuli Reijula

**I am a philosopher and cognitive scientist interested in how science works, how it could, and how it should work.**

I work as a university lecturer (permanent faculty position, roughly equivalent to US associate professor) in [Theoretical Philosophy](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-arts/research/disciplines/philosophy-history-and-art/philosophy) at the University of Helsinki. I’m also affiliated with the [TINT Centre for Philosophy of Social Science](https://tint-helsinki.fi/), and a docent (habilitation / adjunct professor) in [Practical Philosophy](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-social-sciences/research/disciplines-and-research-units/practical-philosophy), University of Helsinki.

The general aim of my research is to **better understand scientific problem-solving**: Science is the humanity's most successful problem-solving system, and the primary source of epistemic authority in modern societies. 

In my research, I view & model science as a distributed cognitive system, "problem-solving writ large." **How does that system function at different levels of analysis** ranging from individual scientists to research groups and scientific communities? 

And **how should it function** - what are the social, cognitive, and institutional preconditions of well-functioning scientific research?

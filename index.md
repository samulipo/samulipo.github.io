**Samuli Reijula (né Pöyhönen)**

I am currently (2020-2025) an Academy of Finland research fellow at the University of Helsinki. I work in the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-of-arts/research/disciplines/philosophy-history-and-art/philosophy" target="_blank">theoretical philosophy unit</a>, and my research focuses on two main areas:
- **Institutional epistemology.** What are epistemically well-designed social systems like? That is, what are the social, cognitive and institutional conditions of well-functioning scientific research?
- **Evidence-based policy.** How are findings from the behavioral sciences used to inform policy design? How should that translation be done?  

I am also interested in the **epistemology of simulation modeling**, **computational social science**, **mathematical explanation**, **AI**, as well as issues related to **natural kinds** and **conceptual change**.

As a university lecturer (currently on research leave), I am responsible for undergraduate teaching and supervising in the area of the philosophy of science. I'm also affiliated with <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/tint/" target="_blank">TINT, the Centre for Philosophy of Social Science</a> at the University of Helsinki.

### Updates
- A new paper coming out in the Philosophy of Science (PSA2020/2021 proceedings). We examine the diversity-beats-ability theorem originally put forward by Lu Hong and Scott Page, 2004. Long story short, (1) we don't think the original model provides reliable evidence of diversity beating ability in group problem solving, but (2) we have an improved version of the model that can tell us something of interest about the trade-off between diversity and ability!
- Here's a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwizze7Ly5DtAhWJmIsKHWWkAcoQFjAAegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftuhat.helsinki.fi%2Fws%2Fportalfiles%2Fportal%2F136646649%2Freijula_ja_ylikoski2020_institutionaalinen_tietoteoria.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3YbM410Q-0mvRxdqyM_rPPlink" target="_blank">link</a> to a paper I wrote with Petri Ylikoski, where we outline the idea of *institutional epistemology*. (in Finnish!) (11/2020)
- I'm on research leave 2020-2025, working on my personal research project funded by the Academy of Finland. The project is called  "Modeling the republic of science: Collaborative problem solving and collective rationality in scientific inquiry" (11/2020)
- Our self-nudging article is getting some attention in media: <a href="/assets/reijula_yliopistolehti_2020-8.pdf" target="_blank">Yliopisto-lehti</a>, <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/innovation/giving-people-the-tools-to-nudge-themselves/" target="_blank">The Decision Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-self-nudging-simple-trick-make-healthier-choices-t184571" target="_blank">NBC Today</a>
- How can philosophers make use of (simulation) models? Together with Emrah Aydinonat and Petri Ylikoski (Synthese, forthcoming 2020), I argue that e.g. in social epistemology (of science), models should be understood as argumentative devices, and their epistemic status be evaluated accordingly.
- "Self-nudging and the citizen choice architect" accepted for publication in Behavioural Public Policy. After more than three years on the drawing board, happy to share results from this collaboration with Prof. Ralph Hertwig. (1/2020)
- Check out our poster from EPSA2019: Reijula & Kuorikoski: <a href="/assets/reijula_kuorikoski_poster_2019_09_08.pdf" target="_blank">Modeling collaborative division of cognitive labor</a>. (9/2019)
- Career news. As of August 2019, I will be a university lecturer in theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki (6/2019)
- A new manuscript/preprint on models, simulations, and Robert Brandom's inferentialism: **Making it count. An inferentialist account of computer simulation**, here: <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9bmr" target="_blank">https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9bmr</a> (6/2019)
- New town, new university! In September 2018 I'm starting as a university researcher at the University of Tampere.

- In June 2018, I'm visiting the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-rationality" target="_blank">Centre for Adaptive Rationality (ARC)</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin. Great to be back!
- In April 2018, I received a 12-month grant from the Emil Aaltonen Foundation for research on the social epistemology of science.

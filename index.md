# Samuli Reijula

**I am a philosopher and cognitive scientist interested in how science works, how it could, and how it should work.**

In 2019 I joined Theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki as a permanent university lecturer (roughly equivalent to US associate professor). Iâ€™m also affiliated with the TINT Centre for Philosophy of Social Science, and a docent (qualification for academic habilitation / adjuct professor) in Practical philosophy, University of Helsinki.

The aim of my current research project is to **better understand scientific problem-solving**: Science is the humanity's most successful problem-solving system, and the primary source of epistemic authority in modern societies. 

In my research, I view & model science as a distributed cognitive system, "problem-solving writ large." **How does that system function at different levels of analysis** ranging from individual scientists to research groups and scientific communities? 

And **how should it function** - what are the social, cognitive, and institutional preconditions of well-functioning scientific research?

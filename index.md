**Samuli Reijula (né Pöyhönen)**

I am currently (2020-2025) an Academy of Finland research fellow at the University of Helsinki. I work in the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-of-arts/research/disciplines/philosophy-history-and-art/philosophy" target="_blank">theoretical philosophy unit</a>, and my research focuses on two main areas:
- **Institutional epistemology.** What are epistemically well-designed social systems like? What are the social, cognitive and institutional conditions of well-functioning scientific research?
- **Evidence-based policy.** How are findings from the behavioral sciences used to inform policy design? How should that translation be done?  

I am also interested in the **epistemology of simulation modeling**, **computational social science**, **mathematical explanation**, **AI**, as well as issues related to **natural kinds** and **conceptual change**.

As a university lecturer (currently on research leave), I am responsible for undergraduate teaching and supervising in the area of the philosophy of science. I'm also affiliated with the <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/tint/" target="_blank">TINT Centre for Philosophy of Social Science</a> at the University of Helsinki.

### Updates
- A new paper coming out in the Philosophy of Science (PSA2020/2021 proceedings). We examine the diversity-beats-ability theorem originally put forward by Lu Hong and Scott Page, 2004. Long story short, (1) we don't think the original model provides reliable evidence of diversity beating ability in group problem solving, but (2) we have an improved version of the model that can tell us something of interest about the trade-off between diversity and ability!
- Here's a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwizze7Ly5DtAhWJmIsKHWWkAcoQFjAAegQIBxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftuhat.helsinki.fi%2Fws%2Fportalfiles%2Fportal%2F136646649%2Freijula_ja_ylikoski2020_institutionaalinen_tietoteoria.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3YbM410Q-0mvRxdqyM_rPPlink" target="_blank">link</a> to a paper I wrote with Petri Ylikoski, where we outline the idea of *institutional epistemology*.

- How can philosophers make use of (simulation) models? Together with Emrah Aydinonat and Petri Ylikoski (Synthese, forthcoming 2020), I argue that e.g. in social epistemology (of science), models should be understood as argumentative devices, and their epistemic status be evaluated accordingly.

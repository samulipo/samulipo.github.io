I'm a philosopher of science interested in ...

Currently Iâ€™m mainly working on projects related to two topics:  
1. **Science as a social system.** What are the social, cognitive and institutional conditions of well-functioning collective knowledge-production?  
2. **Evidence-based policy.** How are findings from the behavioral sciences used to inform policy design? How should that translation (ideally) be done?  

I am also interested in the epistemology of simulation modeling, computational social science, AI, and issues related to natural kinds and conceptual change.

## Current position
Postdoctoral researcher (Academy of Finland)
Social and Moral Philosophy, University of Helsinki

## Selected publications

**Nudge, Boost or Design? Limitations of behavioral policy under social interaction.**  
Forthcoming in *The Journal of Behavioral Economics for Policy.* (w/ Jaakko Kuorikoski. Timo Ehrig, Konstantinos Katsikopoulos, and Shyam Sunder)
